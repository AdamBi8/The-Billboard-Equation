# Final Project: Spotiwhy

## Domain of Interest: An Introduction

### Why are we interested in this domain?

_“Music is a language that doesn’t speak in particular words. It speaks in emotions, and if it’s in the bones, it’s in the bones.”_
― Keith Richards, Singer and Songwriter for the Rolling Stones

According to [Dr. Michelle Millis Chapel](https://michellechappel.com/), a former University of California psychology professor who later turned to a career in music, scientists have discovered [fifteen mental and emotional benefits](https://www.lifehack.org/317747/scientists-find-15-amazing-benefits-listening-music) (and counting) of listening to music. Spanning from stress relief to elevated physical and mental performance across several metrics, the benefits of such an easily accessible commodity are endless. It's no wonder that we make it such a big part of our lives, plugging it in whenever we need a pick-me-up. Music makes us feel **good**.

Yet not all music is created equal, and listeners everywhere carefully cater their playlists to personal preferences. As passionate Spotify users with a shared love for music, our group hopes to use data and information to better understand how songs distinguish themselves and rise to the top within such a competitive space. Tired of trying to distance ourselves from the "overplayed" and the "overrated", we hope to instead explain the bits and pieces that bring a song to such a status.

### What are other examples of data driven projects related to this domain?

Using a subset of the free-to-use Million Song Dataset (MSD) available online, as made available online by the UCI Machine Learning team, Kaggle user Vinay Shanbhag built a [model](https://www.kaggle.com/vinayshanbhag/predict-release-timeframe-from-audio-features) for predicting a song's release year based on features within the music.

Using data collected from the National Endowment of the Arts, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, online real-estate broker Movoto developed an [interactive map](https://www.spin.com/2014/04/interactive-all-american-music-map-by-genre/) depicting American music tastes by state.

Using data scraped directly off of its own web API, Spotify's team created [Spotify.me](spotify.me) in order to give its users insight as to their listening habits. Leveraging the data they collect from running their product, Spotify also launched Spotify for Brands, which uses data from its users in order to help businesses conduct analyses on consumer behavior and patterns.
